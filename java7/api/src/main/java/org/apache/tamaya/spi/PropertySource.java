     * <p>Example: If the properties file/s should be used <b>before</b> the other implementations,
     * you have to configure an ordinal &gt; 400. That means, you have to add e.g. deltaspike_ordinal=401 to
     * /META-INF/apache-deltaspike.properties . Hint: In case of property files every file is handled as independent
     * config-source, but all of them have ordinal 400 by default (and can be reordered in a fine-grained manner.</p>
